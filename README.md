# algorithms

This repository is here for all to see how some basic and semi-complex algorithms work. As well, I encourage you to contribute some of your own algorithms or alternative solutions to the algorithms I have already creates. 
In this repository I have started with the basics of manipulating and parsing through different data types and classes. 
I will be expanding on each section to go further in depth into each data type and how to manipulate each for a specific result. 

Sections:

1. Arrays
2. Strings
3. Objects
4. Stacks
5. Queues
6. Singly Linked Lists

Future Iterations:

1. Sorting algoritms for all data types
3. New Section: Recursion
2. New Section: Binary Search Tree class
3. New Section: String and Number Hashes
4. Rewriting algorithms into Python

If you have any suggestions or requests on materials to add please reach out to me via email or send a pull request and ill get back to you asap.
